For great books on data structures and algorithms in Python:

- [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python (hardcover)](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275)
- [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python (paperback - much cheaper)](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/812656217X/)

- [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230/)
